## Overview

This is a fun and engaging **Tic Tac Toe** game built using **React.js** with unbeatable Tic Tac Toe. Users can challenge themselves to play against an algorithm that uses the minimax algorithm to make the game extremely challenging and almost impossible to win. The game also comes with enhanced UI, animations, and appealing styles to keep users entertained.

## Features

- **Unbeatable**: The Tic Tac Toe Game uses the minimax algorithm, making it very difficult for players to win.
- **Interactive UI**: Styled using `styled-components`, the UI has smooth animations and a responsive design.
